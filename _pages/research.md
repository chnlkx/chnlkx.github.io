# Research

Here are some themes and techniques that we currently work on:

**XENONnT:Dark Matter Direct Detection with Liquid Xenon** 

Welcome to the Tsinghua Group's XENONnT Data Analysis Project! XENONnT, situated at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy, is a forefront experiment dedicated to unraveling the mysteries of dark matter. Our team at Tsinghua University is actively engaged in the data analysis phase, employing advanced statistical and computational methods to interpret the vast datasets generated by XENONnT detectors. By contributing to the global effort, we aim to deepen our understanding of dark matter's fundamental nature and advance the field of particle physics. Join us on this exciting journey as we explore the cosmos and push the boundaries of scientific discovery.

**RELICS: Reactor Neutrino Coherent Scattering Detection with Liquid Xenon** 

The RELICS (REactor neutrino Liquid xenon Coherent Scattering) experiment is a proposed initiative in reactor neutrino research. Its primary goal is to detect the elusive signal of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) from reactor neutrinos, a phenomenon predicted by the Standard Model (SM) in 1974 but challenging to observe due to its low deposited energy. Up to 2023, the COHERENT experiment in 2017 was the only one to successfully observe CEvNS. The RELICS experiment leverages liquid xenon time projection chamber (LXeTPC) technology, a leading technology for detecting rare events like dark matter and neutrinoless double beta decay. Thanks to its ultra-low background and low threshold capabilities, the LXeTPC is well-suited for detecting reactor CEvNS. The experiment will take place at the Sanmen Nuclear Power Plant in Taizhou City, Zhejiang Province, which has a total reactor power of 3.3GW. The experiment's detectors will be positioned about 23 meters from the reactor, where the neutrino flux is sufficiently strong to use a relatively small TPC with a fiducial volume of around 30 kilograms. Prof. Fei Gao from Tsinghua University leads the RELICS experiment, and the collaboration also includes USTC, Sun Yat-sen University, and Westlake University. The experiment is currently under active research and development, and we welcome you to join us!

**RELICS prototype R&D**

With the goal utilizing dual-phased xenon time projection chamber to detect the neutrinos from nuclear reactors. We designed a prototype LXe TPC to test the systems of detectors such as data acquisition, slow control, recycling, purification and so on.
The TPC has been manufactured and assembled in THU local lab. Up to nowï¼Œthe TPC has run four times with few updates.
