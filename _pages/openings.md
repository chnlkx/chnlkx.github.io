# Open positions

**We are currently open for PhD and postdoc applications related to XENON Project and RELICS neutrino experiment.**

We are  looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!

## Applications for Postdoc positions
Currently we have postdoc positions open for the [XENON Project](https://inspirehep.net/jobs/2618429) and the [RELICS experiment](https://inspirehep.net/jobs/2739416).

### Postdoc Fellow - XENON Project
We participate in the XENON project. The XENONnT experiment is currently operated at the Gran Sasso underground Laboratory in Italy, aiming to search for rare physics phenomena such as nuclear recoils from WIMP Dark Matter. Successful applicants are expected to participate in the XENONnT's operation and play a leading role in data analysis. For details of the research projects, please get in touch with Prof. Fei Gao.

### Postdoc Fellow - RELICS Neutrino Experiment
We are developing a liquid xenon time projection chamber to detect the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering from reactor neutrinos. The project is called the REactor neutrino LIquid xenon Coherent elastic Scattering (RELICS) experiment. The RELICS experiment is a 50-kg liquid xenon time projection chamber deployed at a ~25m baseline to the 3.3GW reactor core at the Sanmen nuclear power plant in Zhejiang Province in China. It aims to start its data-taking in 2025. Successful applicants are expected to play a leading role in the design, construction, and data analysis of the RELICS experiment. For details of the research projects, please get in touch with Prof. Fei Gao.


### For both positions:

The initial appointment is for two years, with a possible renewal upon satisfactory performance. Applicants are supported to apply for the "Shuimu Tsinghua" fellowship at Tsinghua University. The "Shuimu Tsinghua" fellows will receive an annual salary of 300,000 RMB (before tax) for two years. Shuimu Tsinghua fellows enjoy the same medical plan privileges as Tsinghua faculty, and their children are offered positions at Tsinghua Universityâ€™s kindergarten and primary school. Shuimu Tsinghua fellows can also participate in career training courses offered to Tsinghua faculty.

Tsinghua provides transitional housing on campus to all postdoctoral fellows. Postdoctoral fellows will be supported to apply for external research funds. Applications will be accepted until the position is filled.

#### Position Responsibilities:
- Conduct original research independently and in collaboration.
- Prepare research papers for publication.
- Present research achievements at seminars and conferences.
                                           
#### Position Qualifications:
- Applicants should have a Ph.D. in experimental high energy physics, experimental nuclear physics, or a related field or should expect to receive their Ph.D. by the time the appointment begins.
- Candidates should have no more than three years in a prior postdoctoral appointment when the appointment begins.
- Evidence of potential for a high level of achievement as an independent researcher.

#### Application Materials Required:
- Cover Letter
- Curriculum Vitae
- (up to 5) Representative Papers or representative works
- Research proposal for work at Tsinghua
- Three Reference Letters
